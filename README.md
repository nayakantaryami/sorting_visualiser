## Purpose

I made this sorting visualizer web application to improve my skills more in
HTML, CSS, and JS. And to help the beginners in programming to gain more knowledge and understanding on sorting algorigthms by visualizing them.


This application supports the following sorting algorithms:
1.**Merge Sort**
Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
Time Complexity: O(n log n)

2.**Quick Sort**
Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the partitions.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average; O(n²) in the worst case.

3.**Selection Sort**
Description: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted region.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

4.**Insertion Sort**
Description: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

5.**Bubble Sort**
Description: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity: O(n²)
